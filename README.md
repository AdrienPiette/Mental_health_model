# Mental Health Prediction Model

## Overview
As remote work becomes the new norm, it's essential to understand its impact on employees' mental well-being. This dataset dives into how working remotely affects stress levels, work-life balance, and mental health conditions across various industries and regions.

With 5,000 records collected from employees worldwide, this dataset provides valuable insights into key areas like work location (remote, hybrid, onsite), stress levels, access to mental health resources, and job satisfaction. It’s designed to help researchers, HR professionals, and businesses assess the growing influence of remote work on productivity and well-being. 🌿📈

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict mental health conditions based on various employee attributes such as age, job role, work location, hours worked, and other features. The model helps to identify individuals who might be at risk of mental health issues, enabling early intervention and support.

## About Dataset


Columns:

- Employee_ID: Unique identifier for each employee.
Age: Age of the employee.
- Gender: Gender of the employee.
- Job_Role: Current role of the employee.
- Industry: Industry they work in.
- Work_Location: Whether they work remotely, hybrid, or onsite.
- Stress_Level: Their self-reported level of stress.
- Mental_Health_Condition: Any mental health condition reported (Anxiety, Depression, etc.).
- Social_Isolation_Rating: A self-reported rating (1-5) on how isolated they feel.
- Satisfaction_with_Remote_Work: How satisfied they are with remote work arrangements (Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied).

  - Age
  - Gender
  - Job Role

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - pickle
  - Flask (if deploying)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mental_health_model.git
   cd mental_health_model
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Model Training

To train the model on the data, you can use the provided Python script `train_model.py`. The training process involves:

1. **Preprocessing the data**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features.
2. **Model selection**: A variety of classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc., are tested.
3. **Model evaluation**: The best performing model is selected based on accuracy, cross-validation score, or other metrics.
4. **Model saving**: The best model is saved using **pickle** for future use.

### Example Usage:

```python
import pickle
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model
with open('best_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Load the scaler
with open('scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

# Example input data (replace with actual new data)
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': [30],
    'Gender': [1],  # Example: 1 for male, 0 for female
    'Job_Role': [2],  # Encode the job role category
    'Industry': [0],  # Example industry
    'Years_of_Experience': [5],
    'Work_Location': [1],  # Example work location
    'Hours_Worked_Per_Week': [40],
    'Number_of_Virtual_Meetings': [3],
    'Work_Life_Balance_Rating': [4],
    'Stress_Level': [3],
    'Access_to_Mental_Health_Resources': [1],
    'Productivity_Change': [0],
    'Social_Isolation_Rating': [2],
    'Satisfaction_with_Remote_Work': [5],
    'Company_Support_for_Remote_Work': [4],
    'Physical_Activity': [2],
    'Sleep_Quality': [4],
    'Region': [0]
})

# Scale the new data
new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Predict mental health condition
prediction = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
print(f'Mental Health Prediction: {prediction[0]}')  # 0 for healthy, 1 for at risk
```

## Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted labels.
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Especially useful for imbalanced classes.
- ROC-AUC: Evaluating the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

## Deployment (Optional)

If you wish to deploy this model as an API for real-time predictions, you can use Flask to expose the model through a REST API. Below is an example of how to use **Flask** to serve the model.

### Steps to Deploy the Model:
1. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

2. Create a file `app.py` with the following content:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import pickle
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # Load the trained model and scaler
   with open('best_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
       model = pickle.load(f)
   with open('scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
       scaler = pickle.load(f)

   @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
   def predict():
       data = request.get_json()  # Expecting input in JSON format
       new_data = np.array(data['features']).reshape(1, -1)

       # Scale the input data
       new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)

       # Make a prediction
       prediction = model.predict(new_data_scaled)

       return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. You can now send HTTP POST requests to `http://localhost:5000/predict` to make predictions.
